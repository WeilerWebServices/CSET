# Responsive Challenges

Practice your media queries!


## Instructions

1. Open up the `index.html` and `styles.css` files in your editor and take a look at what you're starting with.
2. Open up the page in the browser, too. (Note: you can use the commands from the Build Tools Project.)
3. At the bottom of the stylesheet are a list of exercises. Try to add a combination of rulesets, selectors, and media queries where necessary to complete the challenge.

At the end, you can test the page to make sure all challenges are working together.
