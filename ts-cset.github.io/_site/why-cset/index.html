  <h1 class="page-title">Why CSET?</h1>
  <p>Created in 2017, CSET was intended to bridge the widening gap between two methods of instruction for future software developers: traditional four year Computer Science degrees and newer programming Bootcamps.</p>

<p>Traditional CS degrees are long, expensive, and often focus on broader conceptual and theoretical content useful for academia and research but less applicable to a professional programmer. After those four years, a typical CS graduate often has to learn more skills and processes used in a professional environment while on the job because they arenâ€™t covered in the curriculum.</p>

<p>Bootcamps on the other hand were created to be an accelerated and cheaper alternative to start a career in tech by emphasizing these professional skills more than the conceptual ones. However, they often focus on specific tools or frameworks to complete projects quickly without providing context. In a constantly changing industry, this can leave a Bootcamp graduate stranded without enough fundamentals to apply their knowledge to new problems.</p>

<p><img src="/public/images/both.gif" alt="Why Not Both?" /></p>

<p>CSET attempts to be the best of both worlds. With an advisory committee composed of programmers and managers from local technology companies, we actively respond to industry trends and tailor the curriculum to fit. We also provide the context and fundamental skills necessary for students to apply their knowledge across the industry and adapt to any situation. The bottom line: CSET prepares students to learn on their own, the most valuable skill for a trade that discovers new problems and new solutions every day.</p>
